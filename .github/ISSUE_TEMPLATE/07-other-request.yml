        1. Analyze your request to understand the requirements
        2. Determine if it fits into one of our standard categories
        3. Research the technical feasibility and approach
        4. Either implement the solution or provide guidance on next steps
        5. May ask follow-up questions if clarification is needed
        6. Update you with progress and completion
        
        **Expected response time:** 1-3 hours for initial analysis
