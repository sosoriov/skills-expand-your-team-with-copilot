        ## What happens next?
        
        Once you submit this issue, a Copilot coding agent will:
        1. Analyze the technical feasibility of the feature
        2. Estimate the development effort required
        3. Create an implementation plan with milestones
        4. Either implement the feature or provide feedback on why it may not be feasible
        5. Test the implementation thoroughly
        6. Update you with progress and completion
        
        **Expected completion time:** Varies greatly based on complexity (1 hour to several days)
        
        **Note:** Complex features may be implemented in phases. We'll provide updates on the implementation approach.
